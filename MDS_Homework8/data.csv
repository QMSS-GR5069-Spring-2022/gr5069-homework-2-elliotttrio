On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I paid the balances on both cards and the loan. Totaling around {$12000.00} in payments. 

As of today XX/XX/XXXX the cards and loan information has not been reported to the 3 major credit bureaus ( TransUnion, XXXX and XXXX ). For the past 2 years the accounts balances, payments and other details have been rigorously reported 1 or 2 days after each cycle date but now without any valid reason the reporting stopped. 

My XXXX card was reported 48 days ago ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), my XXXX card was reported 39 days ago ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) and the loan was reported 36 days ago ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) ; this means that my accounts were not reported to the credit bureaus for the XXXX cycle dates. I have never experienced this situation with any other bank. 

VISA and MasterCard have specific requirements for the banks regarding credit bureau reporting.  XXXX XXXX clearly is not in compliance with these rules. 

I am in the process of financing a big ticket item purchase ( more than {$25000.00} ) and that is the main reason why I paid the XXXX cards and loan in full so my FICO, XXXX, and other scores will go up before completing the purchase. I have been waiting weeks for XXXX to do its job and update my information correctly. 

I called XXXX CSC on 4 different occasions last week. I was told the accounts information will be sent to the credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX, that didnt happen. Then I was told to submit a dispute ( which I did ), then I was told that the accounts will be updated 1 or 2 days after the month end. Didnt happen. Then a supervisor said it may take a week or even until XXXX for my dispute to be solved. Nobody from XXXX was able to find out why this is happening or tried to contact a credit risk Manager to get a response. I understand that sometimes the customer service center is just the first point of contact with a customer but they are not even capable of escalating a complaint properly. 

More frustrating is that this is an easy problem to be solved. I had a similar case with another bank. I called the bank, the rep transfer me to a risk area supervisor, the supervisor verified the system setup and found the cause, then transmitted my file again. Two days later my updated information was showing on the credit bureaus. 

I am sure that if my account ( or any other customer account for that matter ) was past due, delinquent or over limit, that negative status will be promptly reported by XXXX the next cycle. Is unfortunate that XXXX seems to discriminate the reporting time frame based on a good or bad status. 

Next Wednesday I am planning to complete my big ticket item purchase ( as I can not delay it anymore ) and I expect that XXXXXXXX XXXX will be able to resolve this situation and have my accounts reported to the credit bureaus by then.",Account information incorrect,Consent provided

The highest loan balance through Santander the day I signed this loan agreement was {$11000.00}. I noticed after my first payment that nothing in my payment was going towards my principle. I requested a pay-off letter just to check my balance at pay off versus my loan origination amount and my first payment. The pay off letter sent to me in XX/XX/XXXX was for {$12000.00}. This was a difference of {$590.00} increase within 6 weeks of purchase AFTER a {$400.00} payment that was not credited to the account for 2 months. I called Santander in XXXX of XXXX after seeing these figures. I was told my payment of {$400.00} would not be added until XXXX of XXXX because this "" type of loan '' did not require payments for the first 90 days. I then inquired about the fees and how the loan was growing in amount owed, but no payment was required. I was told that interest would accrue daily and that I could pay the interest off up front to avoid this in the future. I left that phone call more confused than ever. Once my payment was finally credited in XXXX of XXXX I received a statement that showed late charges had been added in XXXX and XXXX of that year. AFTER I was told no payment due for the first 90 days and they were "" holding '' my {$400.00} payment to be applied at the 90 day mark. 
I reached out to Santander again and was told some story about how every lender is "" required to show late fees '' but "" they don't really go on the back end of the loan ''. 
At this point I was ready to give the car back and get out of this scam I had been led into. It was too late to trade back with the dealership and Santander would not work with me at all. 
I was stuck in this. I paid my payments and saved up a down payment for a new car and kept my head down. 
XX/XX/XXXX. I was ready to get out of this horrible loan Santander sucked me into. I tried to trade in the car, but was told the payoff was {$11.00}, XXXX and no dealership would touch it at that negative equity. 
Called Santander to inquire about this ridiculous payoff. I had paid over {$5000.00} in payments and there was no possible way the payoff had only come down {$720.00} in 20 months. 
Santander told me via phone in XX/XX/XXXX that this was the payoff and that I had been making interest only payments each month. I literally lost my mind! I had made the payments required of me and not a single soul had ever told me that this was "" interest only '' payments. I paid over {$5000.00} towards this car and got nothing in return! I gave up fighting and asked them to take the car back because I could not afford to own that loan any longer. I was losing money period. 
Santander arranged for me to turn my car in to them and told me via phone XX/XX/XXXX they would sell it and I would be notified of the date, time, place of the sale in writing and have options related to this sale mailed to me. 
XX/XX/XXXX rolls around. I receive a statement in the mail from Santander showing I owe them over {$8000.00}. I call to find out what is going on now. I am told my car was sold in XX/XX/XXXX and this statement is for the payoff. Sold? I was really confused ( again XXXX. I told them I never received the information in the mail I was supposed to and didn't know anything about a "" sale ''. I was told that was my balance and it would be sold to collections if not paid in 30 days and then hung up on. 
I sent a written request ( the first of many ) to Santander stating I had never been notified of the sale as legally afforded to me as a right by the FTC, that the balance was incorrect as this XXXX vehicle was worth well over {$6500.00} and sold for only {$4300.00} and that is not commercially reasonable, I requested written documentation of the sale and condition of the vehicle at time of sale as I had taken pictures inside and out, I requested the original loan documents showing where I agreed to interest only payments, I requested an account history from time of loan until present. 

I have sent multiple written requests over the past year. I have disputed with the credit bureaus on this as well and received no response other than "" creditor validated information they are reporting is correct ''. I now am showing I have a "" charge off '' from Santander on my credit report of over {$8000.00} and never received any requested validation or verification related to this debt as requested for over a year via phone and mail. 

Santander has broken many laws in relation to my claim. Did not properly disclose the terms of the loan to consumer, did not apply payments to account in timely manner, charged late fees without proper disclosure to consumer, did not notify consumer of payment options and how payments were applied to loan, did not notify consumer of sale of vehicle per state and federal law, has not provided consumer with requested documentation for validation/verification of all information being reported after repeated attempts to obtain. 

XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX have not investigated this claim properly after repeated attempts to show them payments made, all claims above, and evidence submitted. Even requested method of verification and full disclosure of how this was verified with them and have not received valid response. 

This continues to ruin my chances of getting any type of financing and Santander has broken law after law in relation to the way they conduct business and especially service auto loans. Consumer disclosure and document requests are ignored and consumer rights under FCRA, FDCPA, and all other aspects of business legalities are done in shady manner.",Account information incorrect,Consent provided

In XXXX response I was told, The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires lenders and servicers, such as XXXX, who report information to the consumer reporting agencies to do so with accuracy. Therefore, we can not remove accurate information from your credit report. Contrary to these assertions, by failing to update previously reported information, XXXX is in violation of Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA. 
Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA is how a lender is to handle a situation when subsequent information updates a report that was allegedly accurate when it was made but no longer is accurate in the present time ( i.e., the identical situation I am currently in ). 
Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA addresses the duty to correct and update information by furnishers, or persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRA ) such as credit bureaus. In particular, this section requires a person that has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate to promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide any information needed to make it complete and accurate. Thus, on its face, this provision requires a furnisher to provide corrected or updated information to the consumer reporting agency that it had reported to originally. This duty extends to all student loan accounts reported to CRAs, regardless of whether they were accurate at one point, because the section requires the furnisher both to update accounts as well as to correct. 
XXXX CFPB response to Complaint ID XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX states, A review of your account shows that you cancelled the pending payment for XX/XX/XXXX when you spoke with us on XX/XX/XXXX and advised that you would call back and make a double payment in XX/XX/XXXX. When calling back in XXXX, you cancelled the pending XX/XX/XXXX payment and rescheduled a double payment for the last day of the month. When speaking with you on XX/XX/XXXX we advised you the account was current as we were reflecting the XX/XX/XXXX double payment. During this call you also cancelled the XX/XX/XXXX payment. However, the day after the call, the XXXX payment was rejected by your bank. A notice was sent to you the same day the bank notified XXXX that the payment was rejected. Your XX/XX/XXXX payment was also rejected by your bank. A review of your account shows that you updated your address with XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ; however, you continued to receive email correspondence as originally requested in XX/XX/XXXX. Based on your request we have conducted an investigation which confirmed the information we provided to the consumer reporting agencies is accurate. 

The statements above show multiple times where XXXX failed to properly inform me of any impending and current missed payments on my account. XXXX representatives state, A notice was sent to you the same day the bank notified XXXX that the payment was rejected. I never received any notice from XXXX at either of the addresses I was residing at during the months of XXXX and XXXX ; I also never received any notice at my present address for the entire year my mail was forwarded from my previous address ( reference attached email confirmation of mail forwarding from XXXX ). XXXX  representatives also state email correspondences were sent to me, which I dont have any record of receiving, and email is not an acceptable form of correspondence by a lender to inform someone of impending and current missed payments. 
The statements in XXXX CFPB response also show how I acted properly with XXXX customer service representatives by scheduling days for payments to be made on my account. I scheduled for both XX/XX/XXXXs payment andXX/XX/XXXXs payment to be made on XX/XX/XXXX to which a XXXX representative informed me I would receive no late payment penalty for paying on XX/XX/XXXX. To ensure the XX/XX/XXXX payment was received, I called XXXX over two weeks after the payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX to verify receipt of payment, to which I was advised by a XXXX customer service representative my account was current ; due to this statement from XXXX, and with further assurance from the XXXX  representative I wouldnt receive any late payment penalties, I cancelled my XX/XX/XXXX payment and scheduled a new payment for XX/XX/XXXX. Afterwards, and without my knowledge, XXXX concluded my XX/XX/XXXX payment wasnt received. I reviewed my bank records and there are no return item fees in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, nor XX/XX/XXXX. I have already had a documented instance with XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX where a scheduled payment was not processed correctly by XXXX ; this occurred during a three-month probation period for a new payment plan where I was almost disqualified from the program due to a XXXX  payment processing error. XXXX admitted fault over the phone for this error and ensured my eligibility to maintain myself within the new payment program. I believe a similar issue occurred for the payments XXXX claims werent accepted by my bank for the scheduled payment made in XXXX and for the scheduled payment made in XXXX. 
Due to XXXX failure to not only process my scheduled payments correctly, but due to XXXX failure to properly inform me of impending and current missed payments, the fault for the missed payments in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are XXXX responsibility to correct. Since I am not at fault for XXXX mishandling of my account and I acted in a responsible manner to verify receipt of payments with XXXX, I am thus requesting that in compliance with Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA that the nine accounts showing a 60-day and 90 day late payment in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX be updated, corrected, and removed. 
In the event these reports are not immediately updated to accurately reflect a status of no missed payment for the months of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I intend on filing disputes with each credit bureau in addition to official complaints with the FTC, CFPB, BBB, and pursue other legal routes if necessary.",Billing dispute for services,Consent provided

I told them I was shocked that their "" fraud prevention system '' failed to flag this behavior and stop it before it gouged me for over {$8900.00}. I just received a very curt email from Amex today ( XXXX ) saying : "" Hi XXXX XXXX, Recently you inquired about your charge ( s ) from your American Express Prepaid Card in the total amount of {$8900.00}.

( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

Most recent is regarding two items reported as derogatory by XXXX XXXX XXXX where the creditor has refused via phone to validate the debt in writing and also has not responded to the written request to validate the debts within the required time frame of 30 days per the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I was advised by the Equifax rep that I would have to file a complaint with the police first for them to acknowledge these claims, Even though I provided Equifax with supporting documents that validation of the debts was requested. ( As I also reported to CFPB previously ). This was a surprising request and not one required by the other two agencies. I did attempt to file a complaint with my local police but was advised the request by Equifax was unusual in that the federal government had specific guidelines that had to be followed regarding the validation of debts and if this creditor could not prove that had been done timely then that should be all that was needed. Also, that this was a civil matter and not criminal. 
Also, every time I have opened a dispute with Equifax, my credit score is reduced. For example, I had XXXX student loans that were being reported as duplicates and when the dispute was opened on each loan, there was an immediate reduction of XXXX points per loan and my credit score was reduced by a total of XXXX points. It appears that Equifax is penalizing for opening a dispute. 
Please assist in these matters. Is it common to require a police report when a debt collector dies not validate debt in the time frames required by the federal government? And is Equifax supposed to be reducing a credit score when a dispute is opened?",Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,Consent provided

They provided us lease break options for a lease that wasnt fully signed and I told them we would not be paying for twelve months. That, for all intents and purposes, without a twelve month lease, we were still month to month. We stayed through the month of XXXX and XXXX and provided a 30 day notice to vacate, which was outline in the request for renewal form. I told them I would get a lawyer involved and they said, point blank, that a lawyer would cost more and that, if we didnt pay them, they would send me to collections for the amount and that I wouldnt find a place to live while it was on my credit report. Shortly after we moved out, KLS Financial Services, hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX, reached out to me everyday, harassing me with phone calls trying to get me to pay this debt. Mind you, at the time, I thought it for twelve month charges of a lease I didnt sign. KLS didnt provide me a notice or details of the charges, just that I owed the amount. I told them that I disagreed with this claim and I would never pay for this debt. I have since lost my house due to financial struggle and have been unable to find a place to live since this has been on my credit report. So, in an attempt to regain my independence, despite my pride, I called KLS trying to settle the account to get it off my credit. I could not, and still can not, afford the full amount. I offered to pay half of the amount. The representative said they would get in touch with their consumer relations department and get back to me. Later that day, XXXX XXXX of KLS contacted me. She then proceeded to use a series of scare tactics to try and get me to pay the full amount. She said that my credit was the only one effected because I was listed as the primary applicant and threatened to move the collections to XXXX XXXX credit instead. She also said that settling an account doesnt remove a collections from your credit report and creditors still wont rent to me with a settlement on my credit report. I know this to be false because I have settled collections before and they have fallen off just fine and my score has increased since. When I mentioned that I disagreed with the collections because I didnt sign the lease, she said she had a copy of two leases with my identical signatures. I asked for a copy of those documents and she insisted that these documents had been sent to me already. They had not. I emailed her requesting these documents and this is how our email communication began. Throughout the email thread it became evident that KLS and Ms. XXXX did not have enough evidence to support the claim that I owed anything to XXXX XXXX. Even when they brought in evidence from their client, it was the documents that were false from two years. They made the claim that I owe them for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX rent but that I also signed a twelve month lease through an addendum but that there also isnt an existence of a second lease and were also month to month. When I asked for detailed documents of the damages made to the apartment and the invoices of the contractors who completed the work, the only thing they supplied was the walk through paperwork. They refused to do a walk through with us and that could easily be falsified without the tenants present. Things are not adding up and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and KLS Financial Services have been spouting falsehoods and can not seem to provide accurate evidentiary support to make the claim that I owe them this money and their behavior has been despicable.",Debt is not yours,Consent provided

I provided Capital One with all required documentation. My name was changed successfully - I was issued new cards with my correct name for all of my credit cards and debit cards. 

My husband called Capital One about a week ago to request new checks on our joint Capital One Interest Online checking account. We received the checks earlier this week. When we reviewed the checks, my name was spelled incorrectly with the former spelling ( XXXX XXXX ). 

We called Capital One to inquire as to what happened. We were told that while my name was updated for all of my credit cards and 360 bank account, the name was not changed with the Interest Online checking account. So we asked the rep to simply look at the existing accounts that I have and make the name update, to which we were told Capital One can't do that without proper documentation ( marriage certificate and drivers license ). We advised the rep that we've already worked with Capital One to provide everything needed for all my other accounts and the rep advised that he still couldn't do it because "" the procedures for the Interest Online checking account are different ''. 

I've attached a copy of my marriage certificate and drivers license to this complaint.

The name on the check drawn on this PNC account is clearly stated as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and below it the words "" A wholly owned subsidiary of XXXX XXXX '' The only other name on the check is XXXX, which is not a business but the name of the US Defense Department Health Care program and could therefore not possibly be the name on the account. My attorney instructed the branch manager to process the garnishment with the account number attached to the following possible FEIN 's as provide by a private investigator : XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX There should not be a problem processing the garnishment unless the name on the check does not match the name on the account. If that is the case then the name on the check is a misrepresntation and therefore should not be allowed by the bank. My complaint is that the bank is allowing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and or XXXX XXXX to have an account with checks that do not correctly state the name of the account holder, therefore making garnishment impossible. Either that is the case or this bank is giving me incorrect information in an attempt to protect their account holder and prevent the garnishment.

Upon  arrival at the store, there was also a promotional sign stating that if you applied for the Pep Boys   credit card and were approved, you would get an additional 15 % off your purchase that day. The manager of the Pep Boys also informed us of the credit card promotion when payment was being discussed. My husband and I each applied for the credit card. Both of us were approved. I purchased the tires for my vehicle on my newly approved credit card and my husband purchased tires for his vehicle on his newly approved credit card. I asked the manager of the store how we would get the 15 % off the individual purchases and he informed me that the credit card company would take the 15 % off. About a month and a half later, after receiving the first statement on my credit card, I called the credit company that had issued the card from Pep Boys, Synchrony Bank, to ask how/when the 15 % off would be applied to the purchase. The representative at Synchrony Bank informed me that it could take up to 3 billing statements for the 15 % to be applied to purchase and to pay the minimum payment until i saw the statement credit applied. In the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX I still did not see the 15 % come off on either my husband or I 's statements for our credit cards. I then called Synchrony Bank again and a representative told me she did not know which promotion I was talking about and that there was no record of a promotion like what I was describing existing. The representative at that time suggested I call the Pep Boys store I made the purchase at to get more information about the promotion and to call back. I then called the Pep Boys I made the purchase at and the manager could not remember this credit card promotion either. I then went online and found the Pep Boys flyer from the time frame of my purchase ( https : //blackfriday.com/ads/black-friday/pep-boys/2 ) and realized that I was wrong about the promotion being 15 % because in the flyer it stated 10 % ( up to {$50.00} ) would be paid as a statement credit. I then called back Synchrony Bank and a representative informed me that in order to be eligible for the promotion I needed to have registered for the promotion by a certain date in XX/XX/2018 and the promotion only applied to purchases that were over {$490.00}. Even when i gave this representative the link to the above mentioned flyer, she told me that this was a Pep Boys promotion and had nothing to do with Synchrony Bank.

They scanned my computer and told me I had a lot of viruses and needed to purchase the antivirus software through their company and my computer would be lifetime warrantee with their company antivirus software. The price was {$540.00} so I purchased it and they said I could call them anytime something went wrong with my computer and they would help me at no cost. My computer was running great since XXXX, then on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  called me ( several different men spoke with me : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) and said their company is closing and they wanted to give a refund of {$540.00}. He said they could not send checks out because they are closing. He said he had to refund me on my usbank account and could wire me the money right to my account. He was doing a lot of stuff on my computer and he said to type in my name, address and then type in {$600.00}, I said I thought it was only {$540.00} and he said we are giving {$600.00} for the inconvenience and taxes, etc. He then had me type in my name again, address, and then he would type the first part of it and then he would say ok now you type. Then when I went to type in $ the number 4 kept popping up and he started to get angry with me and said you have to be very careful and not type in anything wrong and you cant hit the backspace. It took about three times and finally on the third time when I typed in {$600.00} he then added a zero so it said {$6000.00}. I kept saying No that is wrong it says {$6000.00} and he wouldnt listen and then he freaked out on me and said oh my XXXX what did you do, that money went into your account, you need to get that money back to me or I will get fired. I can not believe this has happened. You are responsible to get that money back to me. This is a nonrefundable account that it came from so we have to figure out how you can get the money back to me. Then he showed me my usbank and it showed an extra {$6000.00} in the account. Looking back now they had access to my computer and could change any of the numbers. He told me they are partners with XXXX and I would need to get XXXX gift cards for {$6000.00} and keep him on the phone. This phone conversation was over an hour and half long on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX you can listen to the entire conversation if XXXX & XXXX has the capability to share that information. He told me to keep him on the phone the entire time, but not to tell anyone. I kept him on the phone, I was shaking and I went into XXXX and purchased {$5000.00} in XXXX gift cards on my usbank credit card then he told me to get XXXX XXXX gift cards for {$400.00} and the store only allowed me to purchase {$100.00} of that. Then I got back in my car, still shaking I wanted to get this guy his money back for fear that I would be in trouble. He said to stop at a XXXX or gas station and purchase {$300.00} more in XXXX XXXX   cards so then it would total {$5400.00} and the other {$600.00} I would keep because that would be my refund amount. I questioned him several times in our phone conversation and said I feel like I am doing something illegal and I said do you swear on your life that you are not lying to me and I will have this money in my account. He said yes yes of course. I asked what religion he was and he said XXXX. I said I am a XXXX and I dont want you to lose your job and I would hope someone would do the same for me. He then said yes yes and you are responsible to get this money back to me or you could be in a lot of trouble too. Then I went to the XXXX gas station to purchase XXXX XXXX cards for {$400.00} but my credit card was declined. Then he told me to go to XXXX and my credit card was declined there too. I said sir I am so sorry I need to get back to work I have class coming in a little bit. He said ok scratch off the numbers on the back of your gift cards and read them to me, so I did. Then he said ok let me get the receipts in order and Ill make sure everything goes through. I taught my classes still shaking and then he called back and said {$2000.00} didnt go through and you need to get me that {$2000.00} today. I said I couldnt get it until the next day. I then checked my account again and the {$6000.00} was not in there. I confronted him and he said you cant have that money until the gift cards go through. Then I said I am at the point where I am going to involve the police, then he got really mad and locked up my computer and said he will erase everything off my computer and will keep my computer locked until I give him his money. He said if I want my money back I need to do what he says. So then I went to the XXXX  XXXX using my XXXX and bought XXXX XXXX   gift cards for {$1000.00}. Then at XXXX on the XXXX  card I bought XXXX XXXX gift cards for {$1000.00}. Then he wasnt going to unlock my computer until the money went through. The next morning he did not unlock my computer and no money was in my account like he said so I called chief police and met at the police department with him and filed a police report. I brought my computer into XXXX XXXX to have them unlock it and clean it up and put a new antivirus software on my computer. I called all three credit card companies and labeled this as fraud. Both XXXX and XXXX XXXX both immediately when I called gave me a provisional credit and have labeled it as fraud and I am not liable to pay that money back. I would hope USBANK Visa would do the same. I have been a loyal customer with USbank visa for well over ten years I believe and usbank checking/savings for 17 years. XXXX card I have been with for 17 years and never ever had bad credit. My credit score is over XXXX and I am an honest trustworthy XXXX, parent, friend, and XXXX in our society. There is no way I will ever be able to pay USbank visa back {$5100.00} and I should NOT have to because of this Fraud I will do whatever I can with the police to try to get these XXXX XXXX guys closed down so they do not scam anymore people and I will fight this fraud case as long as I have too. This is morally wrong and unacceptable and I DO NOT want this to happen to any more innocent people.

Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 
1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

In the letter, which was not sent certified, I am told that XXXX XXXX from the company wants to garnish my wages for a medical bill that is nearly 13 years old. 
The letter has a date stamp of XX/XX/XXXX, yet the postmark shown on the envelope shows the letter was mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX. 
There is no information showing what this bill is for ( although I  was in a XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, so I can only deduce that this is what this collection is about ). All of my medical bills from the XXXX XXXX  were on my credit report for 7 years and after the seven years, the credit reports that were printed off showed that the judgement from this company had been written off. Now I am getting notice of a wage garnishment. 
I will be including copies of the information that CACH sent to me. Allegedly, the date of judgement was on XX/XX/XXXX. Since that time, the judgement does not show on any of my records. Initially there was a judgement on my record but it was removed after the statutes of limitations had expired. It had been listed as written off and was removed from my record. 
Nothing on my credit report shows a new judgement. 
You will note that the creditors claim shows that the date of the judgement was on XX/XX/XXXX ( which is not accurate if you view my personal records ) and says : Unpaid balance on judgement : {$3900.00} Unpaid post judgement interest : {$3400.00} Total amount owe3d by debtor : {$7400.00} This is rediculous. The judgement had already been written off, I am on state aid and when I found out that this judgement was written off, I didnt expect it to haunt me nearly 10 years later. 
The papers I got were not formally sent to me requesting a signature, nor have I been contacted by this company in years. I will be providing all of the information in the hopes that this will get resolved. If a company writes off a debt and a judgement is realeased and removed, there is no way that this should continue to follow me, and now they are trying to seek wage garnishment.",Threatened to sue you for very old debt,Consent provided

We moved and changed addresses in XXXX and still never received a bill or collection letter. My husband and I began the home buying process in XXXX and were told that I had an Amsher collection for XXXX sitting on my credit for {$160.00}. I was totally confused about the lack of communication from Amsher before placing it on my credit.

I called Amsher back to inquire how the credit reporting would look once they got the account back and was rudely told that they would update it as "" settled '' instead of "" paid '' or delete it all together. I waited until the 5th business day, XXXX, to call Amsher to inquire about the credit reporting and was told a rep named XXXX to call the law office because my account was "" closed ''. I called the law office and inquired about the situation and they said that they'd already notified Amsher of my account status and to call them back to inquire about credit reporting because the law office DID NOT have anything to do with the credit reporting. I called Amsher back and spoke with XXXX again who told me to again call the law office and speak with a Mr. XXXX because the account was closed and she didn't have any additional information. I called the law office AGAIN, and the rep XXXX said that the law office DOES NOT have anything to do with the credit reporting and that Amsher would have to be the one to update or remove the collection because they put it on. She told me to speak with a manager. By this time, I was frustrated and confused with the runaround. I called Amsher back and spoke with a XXXX who tried to send me back to the law office, but I told her that I'd just got off the phone with them and that the law office was strongly suggestive that I speak with a manager because they don't do anything about credit. XXXX put me on hold and then came back to say that I had to call the law office. When I told her again that I'd just spoken to the law office, a very rude manager, XXXX, got on the phone and rudely explained about their contract with the law office and that the law office would provide me with everything that I needed, including the credit reporting. I tried to get a word in but he interrupted me and then rudely hung up. I called Amsher back to speak with another manager over XXXX, and I could hear people in the background laughing and the rep became extremely rude when I asked to speak to a manager over XXXX. She stated that I'd already been spoken to and since I didn't want to speak with them before, she wasn't going to speak with me now and hung up. I ended up calling the law office who stated to complain higher and report Amsher 's refusal to assist to the credit bureau 's. Frustrated, I called XXXX who tried to help by calling Amsher. The rep at Amsher lied to the XXXX rep and said they have to send the law office a notification and wait for the law office which usually takes 5 days.

401,complaint-public-v1,complaint,3253141,1.0,,222XX,3253141,False statements or representation,2019-05-24T12:00:00-05:00,VA,N/A,Debt collection,True,Closed with explanation,"Commonwealth Financial Systems, Inc.",Web,2019-05-24T12:00:00-05:00,,I do not know,Yes,"On XX/XX/2019, a representative of Commonwealth Financial Systems , Inc. called me from ( XXXX ) XXXX ( a XXXX XXXX, CA area-code ). The representative identified herself being simply from the Commonwealth. After further questioning from me and evasion from her, she advised that it is a law firm. During the call, she asked me if I know a person to which I replied that the person is my mother. The representative then went on to tell me to pass along a message to my Mother that all of her bank accounts, finances, and house are in legal jeopardy and that a summons was already in process and would be filed against her if she failed to contact them. The fact the person that called me represented that they were from the Commonwealth is clearly is meant to indicate that they are a government entity which they are not. She represented that the organization is a law firm which they are not. And then she threatened that there is litigation occurring on this matter. In addition, when I asked about them being a law firm in California not once was I corrected that about their true location. 

After significant amount of research trying to figure out the legitimacy of the organization in whether or not to relay that message, I discovered that they are neither a law firm, nor a government entity. This organization is a debt collection entity, in fact, located in XXXX, Pennsylvania. The debt collection agency is called Commonwealth Financial Systems , Inc. ( formerly XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and they are located at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, PA XXXX. Their website is : https : //www.cfsi-arm.com/. 

In my brief phone call interaction with them, I believe there were likely three significant legal violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act 15 U.S.C. 1692-1692p. Plain reading of the Code, says it is illegal for debt collectors to represent themselves as 1 ) government representatives or 2 ) attorneys, and finally, 3 ) when the representative told me to pass along a message of legal  jeopardy, that was likely illegal as well. First of all, if there was in fact a legitimate debt ( which I highly doubt ), I suspect that the statute of limitations for legal action would have already expired and, therefore, the threat constitutes an untrue claim of legal action. But secondly, it seemingly constitutes an untrue claim of legal action anyway since they are not a law firm and likely have no intention of the threat. 

It would be one thing if this was one over-zealous employee, but my research clearly indicates that Commonwealth Financial Systems is apparently systematically unethical at best andperhaps training their employees to commit crimes at worst. They are debt collection service, and -- after looking at hundreds of negative reviews about their unscrupulous and shady practices it is seems obvious that they are at using illegal tactics and unethical methods in an effort to achieve their mission. But do not take my word for it in addition to the easily accessed thousands of complaints against Commonwealth filed with the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, here are links to hundreds of reviews online which indicate all manner of unethical and illegal behavior of all kinds : XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX -- XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   & XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX & XXXX & XXXX # XXXX, ,, But their illegal and/or unethical behavior is also described by those that know them best the employees and former employees at Commonwealth Financial Systems. For instance, one reviewer says specifically that they use Unethical tactics to collect debt. Another employee says : The majority of people who work at this company have criminal records from misdemeanors to multiple felonies. I sat next to a man who served time for man slaughter.  The same reviewer goes on to explain casual drug use at the company. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Based on the work culture referenced here and their ultimate product, it makes clear sense that they systematically employ a number of former offenders to do their illegal and unethical work without question. 

Finally, they are absolutely without transparency and intentionally and falsely misleading, likely in an attempt to bolster their credibility. For instance, on their website under the heading of awards they represent that they received an award from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX is not, in fact, a member of the XXXX and they have certainly have never received an award. They are clearly trying to falsely claim some of the credibility capital of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. In addition, they display the logo of XXXX XXXX ( the American trade group representing the collection industry ). While they are listed as a member on the XXXX XXXX website, their listed phone number is disconnected, and the website address listed there does not work. In addition, multiple phone numbers for them are not linked to the company, including the number on their own website of ( XXXX ) XXXX. Furthermore, trying to confirm their address to formally make a complaint is nearly impossible. In fact, I would encourage anyone investigating to attempt to find an appropriate number for them and simply call them to confirm their address. They are extremely hesitant to even simply provide their mailing address and I had to make multiple calls before I was able to do so. They are clearly trying to avoid any type of transparency in business surely because they could potentially be held accountable for their illicit and unethical actions.","Impersonated attorney, law enforcement, or government official",Consent provided

Being an existing Capital One Bank customer, I was approved within minutes.

I received the card on XX/XX/2019, and began using it almost immediately.

On XX/XX/XXXX - less than one week after I received the card - I received a call from XXXX XXXX at the Capital One Fraud Department, informing me that my account is being frozen until the company can review my tax transcripts. In order for this to happen, she informed me, it would be necessary for me to fill out a copy of IRS form 4506-T,  which she would send me via email.

Within minutes of our conversation, I received an email from Ms XXXX with a link attached for a XXXX  version of that form.

I was, unfortunately, impossible for me to fill out the form that I was sent. My wife and I file taxes jointly, with her name appearing first. In that situation, the IRS requires that my wife 's name be written on line 1a, and mine on line 2a of the form. In the XXXX  version of the form that I was sent, line 2a was blocked out, and could not be filled.

I immediately called Capital One to request a new copy of the form. My request was not honored.

Since then, I have called the Capital One Fraud Department at their published phone number no less than 6 times - twice on XX/XX/XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and twice on XX/XX/XXXX. I have spoken with 6 representatives, including two managers, XXXX   and XXXX. I have spent close to 3 hours on the phone with their agents. On each occasion, I was told that my issue can only be resolved by the case owner - that is, Ms XXXX. Only she has the power to send me a new copy of that form.

Each time, the representatives I spoke with promised to forward my request to her, but I have since received no response.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was promised that I would receive a new form via email by the close of that business day, but that email never materialized.

I made several requests to speak with the case owner directly, but was first told she was unavailable, and later told that she does not ever accept phone calls.

I have also made several attempts to contact Ms XXXX directly by email, and have received no response from her.

All I need is for Capital One to resend me IRS form 4506-T for joint filers. I believe my request is quite simple and straightforward, and do not understand why they can not send me said form. Why is this a weeks-long process involving hours of my time spent on the phone?

If you could arrange for Capital One to deal with this issue and send me the form in an expedited fashion, so that I can get my account unfrozen ( defrosted? ), it would be greatly appreciated.",Problem with customer service,Consent provided

If I fail to pay by XX/XX/XXXX, I am subject to a {$91.00} late fee and possibly issues with my credability. I made an online payment from by checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX bank for the {$2200.00} on XX/XX/2019. Since this is an electronic payment, Dovenmuehle should ( and usually does ) receive the payment by the next business day, which was XX/XX/XXXX. The full amount of {$2200.00} was deducted from my checking account XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX bank on XX/XX/2019 with an entry "" BP-Dovenmuehle Mortg Conf # - XXXX '' See XXXX XXXX XXXX Statement attached ). However, on XX/XX/2019 and to my surprise and dismay, I got a call from XXXX at Dovenmuehle 's Collections Department saying I failed to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment and that I now owe them the {$91.00} for the late fee. I told XXXX that I paid Dovenmuehle on XX/XX/XXXX. She later confirmed this. I asked her to investigate why I was being called when I in fact made the payment. XXXX was unable to help. 
Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, Dovenmuehle finally issed a statement ( see attached ) to reflect my XX/XX/XXXX payment ( this is usually done only a couple of days after I pay ) saying I made the XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. No where does it say in the statement or elsewhere that my payment was timely. 

I need a written statement from Dovenmuehle that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was timely and not subject to a late fee and was received well before the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I also want investigated whether this behavior on the part of Dovenmuehle is in any way retaliatory or connected with my recent application for loan modification to XXXX XXXX at Dovenmuehle due to me being unemployed and being the subject of another complaint I am making to Dovenmuehle. In other words, this instant unusual behavior seems to occur just after I applied for and then appealed and was denied a loan modification due to my long term unemployment, and my subsequent complaint to XXXX and XXXX. I would like to know if they are bullying me as a result and if I shluld expect more of this kind of behavior from Dovenmuehle in the future.",,Consent provided
