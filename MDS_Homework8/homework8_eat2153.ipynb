    ">The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily.\n",

The key is used to overcome security weaknesses with shared credentials. When the user enters their key into the API client (along with other steps) and the it is identified as a recogized credential, the user then have access to the data. \n",

If you have a choice of the output the API returns (e.g. XML or JSON), I suggest to choose JSON because it easier to work with.
